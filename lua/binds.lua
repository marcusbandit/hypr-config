-- #! Apps

hl.bind("SUPER + SPACE", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("banditshell launcher toggle"))

-- The calculator panel, out of the sidebar's flank. A toggle like every other
-- surface, and SUPER+K was free. The launcher answers a sum typed straight into
-- it (SUPER+SPACE, "2+3*4", Enter puts 14 on the clipboard), so this is for the
-- sums worked through a step at a time rather than for every one of them.
hl.bind("SUPER + K", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("banditshell calculator toggle"))

-- The same calculator with the whole screen, which is what the launcher's
-- Calculator entry runs and what the control on the panel's own readout moves it
-- to. On a key as well because the button needs the panel already out, and the
-- big one is sometimes what you wanted from the start.
--
-- SUPER+SHIFT+K IS TAKEN (the on-screen board, at the bottom of this file), so
-- this is on ALT. Both verbs toggle, and the shape is sticky: whichever you last
-- used is the one SUPER+K reopens.
hl.bind("SUPER + ALT + K", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("banditshell calculator app"))

-- The key some keyboards grew for this. Costs nothing on the ones that did not:
-- Hyprland never fires a bind whose keysym the layout cannot resolve. `bindl` so
-- it keeps working with the session locked, like the volume keys below.
hl.bind("XF86Calculator", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("banditshell calculator toggle"), { locked = true })

-- The original carried an inline window rule: `exec, [pseudeo; size 3440 1440;] $browser`.
-- It is deliberately NOT ported. Two independent reasons: "pseudeo" was a typo for
-- "pseudo", so hyprlang never recognised the rule and it has been inert all along,
-- and the 3440x1440 sizing was written for banditbox's ultrawide, not for this
-- laptop. So the browser just launches, which is what has actually been happening.
hl.bind("SUPER + B", hl.dsp.exec_cmd(browser))

hl.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + B", hl.dsp.exec_cmd(browser .. " --private-window"))
-- The shell's own file browser (banditshell modules/files/), rather than yazi in
-- a terminal window. It is a real window, so it could be given a path -
-- `banditshell files toggle <dir>` opens there - but bare it opens wherever it
-- was left, which is what a toggle means everywhere else in this file.
-- Was: hl.dsp.exec_cmd(terminal .. " -e " .. filemanager)
hl.bind("SUPER + E",         hl.dsp.exec_cmd("banditshell files toggle"))
hl.bind("SUPER + RETURN",    hl.dsp.exec_cmd(terminal))

-- Copilot key: remapped to a plain Super modifier by keyd (/etc/keyd/default.conf).
-- The hardware chord Super+Shift+F23 never reaches Hyprland anymore, so no bind here.


-- #! Utils

-- Shell
hl.bind("SUPER + P", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("banditshell session toggle")) -- Toggle Power Menu
hl.bind("SUPER + L", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("loginctl lock-session"))      -- Lock the session

-- THE WAY OUT, and it is the least clever bind in this file on purpose.
--
-- Several banditshell surfaces take the keyboard EXCLUSIVELY while they are
-- up (the launcher, the power panel, the hotkey sheet, a pinned menu) and put
-- a full-screen region into the input mask so a click anywhere off them puts
-- them away. Each is right on its own. Together they mean that a surface left
-- open by something that died mid-sequence takes the whole desktop with it:
-- no window holds focus, so SUPER + LEFT/RIGHT have nothing to act on, and
-- every click lands on the shell instead of on what is under it. The desktop
-- looks frozen while being perfectly healthy.
--
-- You cannot type your way out, because the terminal does not have the
-- keyboard either. A compositor bind still fires, so this is the only rescue
-- that can work.
hl.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + ESCAPE", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("banditshell close")) -- Shut every shell surface (rescue)

-- banditshell has no sidebar drawer, dashboard or hideable bar yet, so these
-- three have nothing to talk to now that caelestia is no longer the shell. Left
-- here rather than deleted, as the list of what still has to be built.
-- hl.bind("SUPER + N",         hl.dsp.exec_cmd("caelestia shell drawers toggle sidebar"))   -- Toggle Notification panel
-- hl.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + D", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("caelestia shell drawers toggle dashboard")) -- Toggle Dashboard
-- hl.bind("SUPER + Z",         hl.dsp.exec_cmd("caelestia shell bar togglePersistent"))     -- Toggle Bar

-- Clipboard
hl.bind("SUPER + J",      hl.dsp.exec_cmd("~/.local/bin/ollama-clipboard"))                                -- Send Clipboard to Ollama

-- Voice dictation: tap to start, tap again to stop and type.
--
-- One bind, not the press/release pair this used to be: with a toggle the key
-- is not what holds the mic open, so there is nothing to bind on release.
-- Because the keyboard no longer tells you the mic is live, the daemon puts up
-- a notification that stays on screen for the whole recording, and caps a
-- forgotten session so it cannot record for hours.
--
-- This key used to launch `xhisper`, which has not existed on this box for a
-- while, so the bind and its submap were both dead. Same key, working tool.
hl.bind("SUPER + R", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("voice toggle")) -- Dictate: tap on, tap off

-- Retype the last transcription, wherever focus is now. No mic, no Whisper: it
-- replays the text the daemon already has, so it is instant and identical every
-- time. For the miss - focus was on the wrong window, the field ate it, an undo
-- went one step too far - where saying a long paragraph again is the expensive
-- part, not the typing. Refused while a recording is live, so it can never
-- interleave with the dictation it would be replaying.
hl.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + R", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("voice retype")) -- Retype last dictation

-- The wallpaper, which banditshell draws itself now: its own surface on the
-- background layer, so swww has nothing left to put a picture on and is not
-- running. The old bind is kept below rather than deleted, because the day swww
-- comes back it is the line you want.
--
-- TEMPORARY HOME. This key is only borrowed until the toggle finds a better
-- one; `banditshell wallpaper next` is the closest thing to what W used to do
-- if you would rather have that here.
hl.bind("SUPER + W",         hl.dsp.exec_cmd("banditshell wallpaper toggle"))                   -- Wallpaper on/off
-- hl.bind("SUPER + W",      hl.dsp.exec_cmd("~/.local/bin/swww-random"))                       -- Cycle backgrounds
